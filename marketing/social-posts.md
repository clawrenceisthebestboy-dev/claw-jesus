## Reddit — r/MacApps Post

**Title:** Claw Back — one-click install, snapshot, and restore for your local AI setup (Ollama + OpenClaw) on Mac

**Body:**

Hey r/MacApps 👋

I built **Claw Back** — a native macOS app that makes managing your local AI stack actually bearable.

**The problem it solves:**
If you run Ollama or OpenClaw on your Mac (especially a Mac mini M4), you know the pain: something updates, something breaks, and you're back to Googling how to reinstall everything. It's exhausting.

**What Claw Back does:**
- 🍎 **One-click install** of Ollama + OpenClaw — no Terminal, no Homebrew fumbling
- 📸 **Snapshots** — save your entire working AI setup with one click
- 🔄 **One-click restore** — something broke? Click Reset and you're back to your last snapshot in ~30 seconds
- 🩺 **Health dashboard** — see what's installed, what's running, what version everything is at a glance
- 🔒 **100% local** — nothing leaves your Mac

**Pricing:**
- 24-hour free trial (card required, won't be charged if you cancel in time)
- $14.99/month or $99/year
- Annual plan covers 2 Macs

I'm a Mac mini M4 owner myself who was tired of babysitting my AI setup. Built this to scratch my own itch.

Waitlist + early access: **clawback.app/waitlist**

Happy to answer any questions!

## Reddit — r/selfhosted Post

**Title:** I built a GUI tool for managing Ollama + OpenClaw on Mac — one-click install, backup, and restore

**Body:**

Hey r/selfhosted 🙌

If you self-host AI on a Mac (Mac mini M4 especially), this might be relevant to you.

I built **Claw Back** — a native macOS app that wraps Ollama and OpenClaw management in a GUI, so you don't have to live in Terminal.

**Why it exists:**
The self-hosted AI workflow on Mac is genuinely fragile. Updates break things. Configs drift. You forget what you had installed. I got tired of re-doing my setup from scratch and built a proper backup/restore tool for it.

**What it does:**
- Installs Ollama and OpenClaw from scratch (GUI, no CLI needed)
- Takes "snapshots" of your running setup — configs, settings, etc.
- Restores any snapshot with one click
- Shows a live health/status dashboard for everything running
- Everything stays local — no cloud sync, no telemetry, no data leaving your machine

**What it doesn't do:**
- Backup model weights (those are big, you manage those yourself)
- Anything cloud-related (intentionally — it's a self-hosted tool)

**Tech:**
- Native macOS app (macOS 14+)
- Apple Silicon optimized, Intel compatible
- License validation via machine ID hash (minimal footprint)

**Pricing:** $14.99/mo or $99/yr. 24-hour free trial.

Still in early access. Joining the waitlist gets you first access: **clawback.app/waitlist**

Roast my choices in the comments — genuinely curious what the selfhosted community thinks.
